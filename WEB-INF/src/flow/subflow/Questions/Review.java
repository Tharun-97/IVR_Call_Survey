 * The Data class handles many types of server-side operations including data

 * assignments and operations (like copying variable values, performing mathematic
 * operations, and collection iteration), conditional evaluation to control callflow
 * execution based on variable values, and logging/tracing statements.
 * 
 * Items created in the getDataActions() method are executed/evaluated in order
 * and if a condional branch condition evaluates to "true" then the branch is
 * activated and the execution of data actions is halted.  If no "true" conditions
 * are encountered, then all data actions will be executed/evaluated and the 
 * application will proceed to the "Default" servlet.
